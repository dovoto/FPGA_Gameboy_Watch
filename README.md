# FPGA_Gameboy_Watch
Full gameboy and gameboy color Verilog Implenentation

Gameboy core is complete with the exception of some Audio features not fully functioning (and bug fixing is, as always, on going). Most gameboy roms work as do most non audio test programs. 

Gameboy color features are 80% implemented.  However, clock speed doubling is not implemented which renders most color games unplayable.

Remaining (besides refactoring)
  Audio system still is buggy enough to label as "incomplete"
  Color Gameboy clock doubling 
  Extensive Gameboy Color debugging is still needed.

This project was started a long time ago...and my coding style and abilities have changed quite a bit in that time...this does make things a bit inconsistant at times and I am slowly refactoring that.
